The script you've provided is named `network_info.sh` based on the name of the file itself. However, the actual functionality of the script is a bit more complex. It's a Bash script that gathers and displays detailed network information, including network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, ARP cache, and active TCP connections.

Here's a more detailed description of what the script does:

- **Network Information Gathering**: The script gathers detailed network information from various system files and commands. It retrieves information about network interfaces, IP addresses, network metrics, routing tables, and the ARP cache.

- **Interface Details**: For each network interface detected, the script prints out the interface name, its IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and network metrics such as packet statistics.

- **Routing Table Display**: The script displays the routing table, showing the destination network, gateway, and other routing information.

- **ARP Cache Display**: The script prints out the ARP cache, which includes the IP to MAC address mappings.

- **Active Connections Display**: The script displays information about active TCP connections, including local and remote addresses, connection state, and other connection details.

- **Output Formatting**: The script uses color variables to format the output for better readability. It also applies bold formatting to the output to make it stand out.

- **Debugging Mode**: The script is run with debugging options enabled (`-xv`), which means it will print each command as it is executed and its output.

The script is designed to be run on a Unix-like operating system with Bash installed, as it uses Bash-specific features and commands. It is not portable to other shells or operating systems without modification.

The provided Bash script is designed to gather and display various network-related information. Let's go through the script step by step to understand how it works:

1. **Shebang Line and Debugging Options**: The first line `#!/bin/bash -xv` specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell and that it should be run in debug mode. The `-x` option enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal. The `-v` option makes the shell print each input line as it is read.

2. **Color Variables**: The script defines several color variables for use in output formatting. These variables are used to change the color of the output text when printed to the terminal.

3. **Gathering Network Data**: The script gathers network data by reading from various system files located in `/proc/net/`. It uses `cat`, `grep`, and `awk` to extract specific information about the network interfaces, IP addresses, metrics, and more.

4. **Displaying Network Information**: The script iterates over each network interface and prints out details about the interface, including its IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and network metrics.

5. **Routes Information**: The script retrieves the routing table information using `netstat` and prints it out.

6. **ARP Cache Information**: The script reads the ARP cache from `/proc/net/arp` and prints out the cached IP to MAC address mappings.

7. **Active Connections Information**: The script reads the active TCP connections from `/proc/net/tcp` and prints out details about each connection.

8. **Printing Output**: The script uses `printf` to format and print the gathered network information, including the network data, routes, ARP cache, and active connections. The `$GREEN$RESET` and `$BOLD` variables are used to apply color and bold formatting to the output text.

9. **Running the Script**: To run the script, you would typically use the terminal. If the script is named `network_info.sh`, you would execute it with the following command:

```bash
bash network_info.sh
```

or, if the script has executable permissions:

```bash
./network_info.sh
```

The script will execute and print out the network information, with each command and its output displayed if the script is run in debug mode (`-xv`).

Please note that the script assumes that the necessary files and commands are available on the system where the script is run. If any of these files or commands are not present or not in the system's PATH, the script may fail with an error. Additionally, the script may require root privileges to access certain system files.

The provided Bash script is designed to execute various network-related commands and display their output in a formatted manner. Let's go through the script step by step to understand how it works:

1. **Shebang Line**: The first line `#!/bin/bash` is called a shebang or a hashbang. It tells the system that this script should be executed using the Bash shell.

2. **Function Definition**: The `execute_cmd` function is defined, which takes a command as an argument and executes it. It also prints a header and footer with dashes to visually separate the output of each command. After executing the command, it waits for 2 seconds (`sleep 2`) to slow down the output and make it easier to read.

3. **Executing ss Commands**: The script executes several `ss` commands with different options:
   - `ss -ss`: Displays summary statistics of network connections.
   - `ss -lnt`: Lists all TCP listening ports.
   - `ss -lnu`: Lists all UDP listening ports.
   - `ss -ant`: Displays all TCP network connections.
   - `ss -antp`: Displays all TCP network connections with the process using the connection.
   - `ss -antup`: Displays all TCP and UDP network connections with the process using the connection.

4. **Executing ip Commands**: The script executes two `ip` commands:
   - `ip addr show`: Shows the network interfaces and their addresses.
   - `ip route`: Displays the routing table.

5. **Executing netstat Commands**: The script executes three `netstat` commands:
   - `netstat -a`: Shows all active connections and listening ports.
   - `netstat -r`: Displays the routing table.
   - `netstat -s`: Displays network statistics.

6. **Executing Other Commands**: The script executes two additional commands:
   - `arp -a`: Displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which contains IP to MAC address mappings.
   - `hostname --all-ip-addresses`: Shows all IP addresses associated with the hostname.

7. **Running the Script**: To run the script, you would typically use the terminal. If the script is named `ipconfig_surveyv2.sh`, you would execute it with the following command:

```bash
bash ipconfig_surveyv2.sh
```

or, if the script has executable permissions:

```bash
./ipconfig_surveyv2.sh
```

The script will execute each command, print the output, and then wait for 2 seconds before moving on to the next command. This delay is intended to make the output easier to follow and to prevent the console from being flooded with too much information at once.

Please note that the script assumes that the necessary commands (`ss`, `ip`, `netstat`, `arp`, `hostname`) are available on the system where the script is run. If any of these commands are not installed or not in the system's PATH, the script will fail with a "command not found" error for those specific commands.
