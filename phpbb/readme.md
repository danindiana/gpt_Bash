Key Issues These Scripts Solve
The scripts I created address all the problems we encountered:
Main Issues We Faced:

Missing Composer - Script auto-installs it
Nginx FastCGI config errors - Script creates clean, tested config
Conflicting site configurations - Script properly manages enabled sites
File permission issues - Script sets correct ownership and permissions
Database setup - Script automates database creation
Path mismatches - Script ensures consistent paths throughout
Missing cache permissions - Script sets phpBB-specific writable directories

How to Use the Scripts
Installation Script:
bash# Download and run the installer
sudo bash phpbb_installer.sh

# Or with custom options
sudo bash phpbb_installer.sh --domain "192.168.1.168" --db-pass "mypassword"
Troubleshooting Script:
bash# Run all diagnostics
sudo bash phpbb_troubleshoot.sh

# Check specific components
sudo bash phpbb_troubleshoot.sh --nginx
sudo bash phpbb_troubleshoot.sh --permissions
sudo bash phpbb_troubleshoot.sh --web
Key Features That Prevent Our Issues:

Error Handling: Scripts exit on first error with rollback capability
Configuration Validation: Tests nginx config before applying
Service Management: Properly starts/enables all required services
Permission Automation: Sets all correct ownership and permissions
Conflict Resolution: Disables default site when enabling phpBB site
Comprehensive Testing: Validates each step works before proceeding
Detailed Logging: All actions logged for troubleshooting
Rollback on Failure: Automatically reverts changes if installation fails

Best Practices for Future Projects:

Always validate configs before applying them (nginx -t)
Use consistent paths throughout all configuration files
Test each component independently (PHP, database, web server)
Set permissions systematically rather than ad-hoc
Enable only one site config at a time to avoid conflicts
Log everything for easier troubleshooting
Test with simple files first before complex applications

These scripts would have saved us hours of debugging! They automate the entire process and include all the lessons learned from our troubleshooting session.
