Optional Hardening & Housekeeping
1. Backups

Your app’s core persistent data—including webui.db, uploads/, vector_db/, plus audit logs and cache—is now consolidated under your specified DATA_DIR (like /var/lib/open-webui). This makes file-level backups straightforward. You can use tools like rsync for incremental backups or typical tar archives.

# Example rsync-based backup script:
#!/bin/bash
SOURCE_DIR="/var/lib/open-webui"
DEST_DIR="/backup/open-webui-$(date +%F)"
rsync -a --exclude="cache/" --exclude="audit.log" "$SOURCE_DIR/" "$DEST_DIR/"


According to Open WebUI’s docs, a typical directory structure looks like this:

├── audit.log
├── cache/
├── uploads/
├── vector_db/
└── webui.db


All of these should be included in your backup strategy.

2. Reverse Proxy & WEBUI_URL

With your service configured behind an Nginx reverse proxy (pointing to 127.0.0.1:5000), setting the environment variable WEBUI_URL ensures that internal URL generation (e.g., for OAuth redirect URIs or API responses) aligns properly with your public-facing domain. This helps avoid mismatches between internal and external URLs.

3. Environment Variable Management & Configuration

Open WebUI offers a wide range of environment variables for customizing its behavior—like port, auth providers, caching, etc. The comprehensive env configuration reference includes notes on which variables are PersistentConfig (their values are stored internally and won't change on restarts unless explicitly updated) and which remain dynamic.

To standardize your setup, it’s a good idea to manage these variables via systemd drop-ins. Examples include:

DATA_DIR=/var/lib/open-webui

WEBUI_SECRET_KEY=...

WEBUI_URL=https://your.domain.com

Advanced options like OLLAMA_BASE_URL, authentication headers, OAuth settings, etc.

This helps maintain consistency and pass environment config cleanly across service restarts.

Here’s a polished **`README.md`** template that captures everything we accomplished today, structured generically so others can adapt it to their own system specifications (OS, Python versions, etc.). It includes setup, migration, backup, and rollback sections—with script names and execution order clearly outlined.

# Open WebUI Environment Setup & Migration

This guide outlines how to set up a reliable and upgrade-safe Open WebUI environment on *Ubuntu 24.04 (or similar)*, including building Python 3.11.13 from source, preserving data across upgrades, and managing rollback scenarios.

> **Note:** Replace `<YOUR_SYSTEM>` placeholders with your actual values (e.g. OS version, system user, paths).

---

##  Prerequisites

- Machine running **Ubuntu 24.04 (x86_64 recommended)**
- Bash-compatible shell (e.g., `bash` CLI)
- Root or sudo privileges
- Target user (e.g., `randy`) for application execution

---

##  Setup & Migration Scripts

| Step | Purpose | Script |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0a   | Build optimized Python 3.11.13 (PGO + LTO, includes `_lzma`) | `build-python-3.11.13-migrate-venv-excl-owui.sh` |
| 0b   | [Optional] Roll back to last known venv snapshot if needed | `--rollback` flag of the same script |
| 1    | Health-check tool for daily monitoring | `owui-healthcheck.sh` |
| 2    | Migration script excluding `open-webui`, retains all other packages, and installs latest Open WebUI | Part of the above build script |
| 3    | Diagnostic script to inspect system state and confirm config | `owui-diagnosev3.sh` |

---

##  Cold-Start Setup Procedure

1. **Run the build-and-migrate script** to compile Python from source and recreate the Open WebUI venv:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build-python-3.11.13-migrate-venv-excl-owui.sh
   sudo ./build-python-3.11.13-migrate-venv-excl-owui.sh
````

2. **Verify functionality**: Ensure the service is running and `_lzma` import works correctly.
3. Optional: Use **`owui-diagnosev3.sh`** to quickly confirm everything is configured properly.

---

## Post-Migration Routine

* Schedule health checks:

  ```bash
  chmod +x owui-healthcheck.sh
  ./owui-healthcheck.sh
  ```
* Set up a cron or monitoring job to run `owui-healthcheck.sh` periodically.

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If something goes wrong after migration, run:

```bash
sudo ./build-python-3.11.13-migrate-venv-excl-owui.sh --rollback
```

This will:

* Stop the Open WebUI service
* Restore the most recent backup venv
* Restart the service with minimal downtime

---

## &#x20;Why These Steps Matter

* **`liblzma-dev` inclusion** ensures `_lzma` module is available in Python for compressed file support. ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59690698/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-lzma-when-building-python-using-pyenv-on) ([Reddit][1], [Stack Overflow][2]))
* **Python built with `--enable‑optimizations --with‑lto`** dramatically boosts runtime performance. ([Python build docs](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/) ([Python Developer's Guide][3]))
* **`make altinstall`** avoids interfering with system Python. ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16018463/difference-in-details-between-make-install-and-make-altinstall) ([makeareadme.com][4]))
* **Using `pip freeze` and filtering** ensures your custom environment is preserved, while still keeping `open-webui` updated to the latest version.

---

## README Style Notes

This `README.md` follows GitHub-Flavored Markdown, featuring:

* Usage of headers (`#`, `##`) for structure
* Code blocks with triple backticks for clarity
* Tables for easy overview
* Instructions in bullet lists for readability

(See GitHub’s Markdown guide for syntax reference.) ([docs.github.com][5], [pyopensci.org][6])

---

### Summary

1. Build optimized Python and migrate venv (excluding `open-webui`).
2. Run health-checks daily.
3. Backup venvs automatically.
4. If needed, rollback with a single flag.

Enjoy a robust, upgrade-survivable Open WebUI setup!
