What does this do? sudo deborphan | xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge

The command you provided is a sequence of commands that work together to identify and remove orphaned packages (packages that are no longer needed by any other package) from your system. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

sudo deborphan:

deborphan is a tool that scans your system and identifies packages that are no longer required by any other package. These are often referred to as "orphaned" packages.

sudo is used to run deborphan with superuser privileges, which is necessary because it needs to access system-wide package information.

| (Pipe):

The pipe (|) is a shell operator that takes the output of the command on the left (in this case, sudo deborphan) and uses it as the input for the command on the right.

xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge:

xargs is a command that reads items from standard input (which is the output of sudo deborphan) and executes the command specified (in this case, sudo apt-get -y remove --purge) with those items as arguments.

sudo apt-get -y remove --purge is the command that actually removes the packages.

sudo is used to run apt-get with superuser privileges.

apt-get is the package handling utility in Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu).

-y is a flag that automatically answers "yes" to any prompts, so the command will not ask for confirmation before removing the packages.

remove is the action that tells apt-get to remove the specified packages.

--purge is a flag that tells apt-get to remove the packages and also delete their configuration files.

What It Does in Summary:
The command first identifies all orphaned packages on your system using deborphan.

It then passes the list of these orphaned packages to apt-get via xargs.

Finally, apt-get removes those packages, including their configuration files, without asking for confirmation.

Important Considerations:
Orphaned Packages: These are packages that are no longer needed by any other package. Removing them is generally safe, but it's always a good idea to review the list of packages that deborphan identifies before removing them.

Configuration Files: The --purge option removes not only the packages but also their configuration files. This can be useful for cleaning up, but it also means that any custom configurations you might have will be lost.

Automated Removal: The -y flag makes the removal process fully automated, which can be convenient but also risky if you're not sure what packages are being removed.

Example:
If deborphan identifies the following orphaned packages:

Copy code
libfoo1
libbar2
The command will effectively run:

Copy code
sudo apt-get -y remove --purge libfoo1 libbar2
This will remove libfoo1 and libbar2 from your system, along with their configuration files.

The output you provided shows the result of running the command sudo deborphan | xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge. Here's a detailed explanation of what happened:

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
sudo deborphan:

This command identified orphaned packages on your system.

| xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge:

The output of deborphan (a list of orphaned packages) was piped (|) to xargs.

xargs took that list and passed it as arguments to sudo apt-get -y remove --purge.

Detailed Output Analysis:
Reading Package Lists and Building Dependency Tree:

The system is reading the package lists and building the dependency tree to determine which packages can be removed.

Identifying Automatically Installed Packages:

The system identified libfontconfig-dev as a package that was automatically installed but is no longer required. It suggests using sudo apt autoremove to remove it.

Packages to be Removed:

The following packages were identified as orphaned and were scheduled for removal:

Copy code
gstreamer1.0-packagekit
libflashrom1
libfontconfig1-dev
libllvm13
libncurses5-dev
libproxy1-plugin-gsettings
libproxy1-plugin-networkmanager
libreoffice-ogltrans
libreoffice-pdfimport
libwmf0.2-7-gtk
libxcb-cursor0
nvidia-utils-535
qemu
steam:i386
Disk Space to be Freed:

After the operation, 103 MB of disk space will be freed.

Removing Packages:

The system proceeded to remove each of the identified packages. For example:

Copy code
Removing gstreamer1.0-packagekit (1.2.5-2ubuntu2) ...
Removing libflashrom1:amd64 (1.2-5build1) ...
Purging Configuration Files:

The --purge option ensured that configuration files for the removed packages were also deleted. For example:

Copy code
Purging configuration files for steam:i386 (1:1.0.0.81) ...
Processing Triggers:

After removing the packages, the system processed any triggers that needed to be handled, such as updating the man-db and libc-bin.

Summary:
The command successfully identified and removed 14 orphaned packages from your system, freeing up 103 MB of disk space. The configuration files for these packages were also purged.

The system also identified libfontconfig-dev as a package that could be removed using sudo apt autoremove.

Important Notes:
Orphaned Packages: These are packages that are no longer needed by any other package. Removing them is generally safe, but it's always a good idea to review the list before removing them.

Configuration Files: The --purge option ensures that configuration files are also removed, which can be useful for cleaning up but also means that any custom configurations will be lost.

Automated Removal: The -y flag makes the removal process fully automated, which can be convenient but also risky if you're not sure what packages are being removed.

If you want to remove libfontconfig-dev as suggested, you can run:

Copy code
sudo apt autoremove
This will remove any packages that were automatically installed and are no longer required.
