### Diagnosis

The issue stemmed from a combination of factors related to protocol selection, printer configuration, and possible transient CUPS/backend errors.

1. **Driver and Protocol Mismatch**:
   - Initially, you attempted to use the `IPP Everywhere` driver with a `socket://` URI. However, `IPP Everywhere` requires an `ipp://` or `ipps://` URI, as it is designed for IPP-based printing.
   - The error `lpadmin: IPP Everywhere driver requires an IPP connection` was indicative of this mismatch.

2. **Backend Errors (Status 4)**:
   - The log shows `[Job 37] Backend returned status 4 (stop printer)`, which often means the CUPS backend encountered a critical issue, such as an inability to communicate with the printer or incompatible configurations.

3. **Duplicate Profiles**:
   - Warnings about `CreateProfile failed` indicate that duplicate color management profiles existed for the printer. While benign, this could be a sign of misconfiguration during re-adding the printer.

4. **Deprecated Drivers**:
   - The warning about deprecated drivers implies that some printer drivers may no longer be fully compatible with newer versions of CUPS. However, this was likely not the root cause but could lead to issues in the future as updates roll out.

### Root Cause of the Problem

- **Initial Configuration Issue**: Using the wrong protocol (`socket://`) with the `IPP Everywhere` driver likely caused the printer jobs to fail.
- **Backend Communication Problems**: The backend failure (`status 4`) suggests a transient communication issue or incorrect printer configuration.
- **CUPS Log Error**: The `IPP server-error-internal-error` hints at possible mismanagement of printer URIs or jobs.

### Future Troubleshooting Checklist

1. **Validate Protocol and URI**:
   - Always match the protocol to the driver. For example:
     - `IPP Everywhere`: Use `ipp://` or `ipps://`.
     - Raw Printing: Use `socket://`.

   Use `lpinfo -v` to list available URIs and ensure proper protocol selection.

2. **Check CUPS Logs**:
   - Review `/var/log/cups/error_log` immediately after encountering issues. Look for:
     - Backend errors (e.g., `status 4`).
     - Internal server errors (e.g., `IPP server-error-internal-error`).

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use `telnet` or `nc` to verify that required ports are reachable (`9100` for raw, `631` for IPP).

4. **Restart Services**:
   - Restart both the printer and CUPS to clear transient errors:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart cups
     ```

5. **Re-add the Printer**:
   - If a printer stops responding, re-add it:
     ```bash
     sudo lpadmin -x printer_name
     sudo lpadmin -p printer_name -E -v correct_uri -m everywhere
     ```

6. **Clear Stuck Jobs**:
   - Remove all pending jobs to avoid blocking:
     ```bash
     cancel -a
     ```

7. **Printer Firmware Updates**:
   - Regularly update the printer firmware to ensure compatibility with newer CUPS versions.

8. **Check for Deprecated Features**:
   - Monitor CUPS logs for warnings about deprecated drivers and prepare for driver migrations.

### Streamlining Troubleshooting

Create a simple script to automate common troubleshooting steps:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Restarting CUPS..."
sudo systemctl restart cups

echo "Checking printer status..."
lpstat -p

echo "Clearing all stuck jobs..."
cancel -a

echo "Showing recent CUPS log entries..."
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/cups/error_log
```
Save this as `printer_troubleshoot.sh` and run it when issues arise. You can customize it to include connectivity checks or protocol validation.

### Conclusion

The primary issue was the mismatch between the protocol and the driver. Now that the correct configuration is in place, the printer should function smoothly. Use the checklist and script for quick diagnostics if similar problems arise in the future.
