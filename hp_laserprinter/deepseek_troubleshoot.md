Your detailed analysis and troubleshooting steps are excellent! Here's a concise summary and some additional suggestions to further streamline your workflow and ensure long-term reliability:

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Protocol-Driver Mismatch**:
   - The root cause was using `socket://` with the `IPP Everywhere` driver, which is incompatible. Always match the protocol to the driver:
     - `IPP Everywhere`: Use `ipp://` or `ipps://`.
     - Raw Printing: Use `socket://`.

2. **Backend Errors**:
   - Status 4 (`stop printer`) indicates a critical backend issue, often due to communication problems or misconfiguration.

3. **Transient CUPS Issues**:
   - Transient errors like `IPP server-error-internal-error` can occur due to mismanagement of printer URIs or jobs.

4. **Duplicate Profiles**:
   - Duplicate color profiles (`CreateProfile failed`) are benign but indicate potential misconfiguration.

5. **Deprecated Drivers**:
   - Warnings about deprecated drivers highlight the need to stay updated with CUPS and printer firmware.

---

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Automate Printer Setup**:
   - Create a script to automate printer setup and reconfiguration:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     PRINTER_NAME="my_printer"
     PRINTER_URI="ipp://192.168.1.100"

     echo "Removing old printer configuration..."
     sudo lpadmin -x $PRINTER_NAME

     echo "Adding printer with correct URI..."
     sudo lpadmin -p $PRINTER_NAME -E -v $PRINTER_URI -m everywhere

     echo "Printer setup complete. Testing print..."
     lp -d $PRINTER_NAME /path/to/testpage.pdf
     ```

2. **Monitor CUPS Logs in Real-Time**:
   - Use `tail -f` to monitor logs in real-time:
     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log
     ```

3. **Enhance Connectivity Testing**:
   - Add a connectivity check to your troubleshooting script:
     ```bash
     echo "Testing printer connectivity..."
     nc -zv 192.168.1.100 631
     ```

4. **Update Firmware and Drivers**:
   - Regularly check for printer firmware updates and CUPS driver updates to avoid compatibility issues.

5. **Document Printer Configurations**:
   - Maintain a configuration file or script for each printer, including:
     - Printer name.
     - URI.
     - Driver/model.
     - Notes on troubleshooting.

6. **Use CUPS Web Interface**:
   - Access the CUPS web interface at `http://localhost:631` for easier management and monitoring.

7. **Set Up Alerts for Critical Errors**:
   - Use a log monitoring tool (e.g., `logwatch` or `rsyslog`) to send alerts for critical errors like `status 4` or `server-error-internal-error`.

### Example Troubleshooting Script

Here’s an enhanced version of your troubleshooting script with additional features:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PRINTER_NAME="my_printer"
PRINTER_URI="ipp://192.168.1.100"

echo "Restarting CUPS..."
sudo systemctl restart cups

lpstat -p

echo "Clearing all stuck jobs..."
cancel -a

echo "Testing printer connectivity..."
nc -zv 192.168.1.100 631

echo "Showing recent CUPS log entries..."
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/cups/error_log

echo "Re-adding printer with correct URI..."
sudo lpadmin -x $PRINTER_NAME
sudo lpadmin -p $PRINTER_NAME -E -v $PRINTER_URI -m everywhere

echo "Printer troubleshooting complete. Testing print..."
lp -d $PRINTER_NAME /path/to/testpage.pdf
```

### Conclusion

By addressing the protocol-driver mismatch and implementing these best practices, you’ve resolved the immediate issue. The additional scripts, monitoring tools, and documentation will help prevent future problems and streamline troubleshooting. Keep an eye on CUPS updates and printer firmware to ensure ongoing compatibility.

To create a script that scans for available IP addresses on your network and allows the user to select one, you can use tools like `nmap` or `arp-scan` for network discovery. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

---

### Steps:
1. **Scan for Available IPs**:
   - Use `nmap` or `arp-scan` to discover active devices on the network.
   - Example: `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` or `arp-scan --localnet`.

2. **Display a Menu of IPs**:
   - Parse the output of the scan to extract IP addresses and present them in a menu.

3. **Allow User Selection**:
   - Use `select` in a Bash script to let the user choose an IP address.

4. **Use the Selected IP**:
   - Pass the selected IP to the printer setup script.

---

### Example Script

Here’s a complete script that scans for IPs, displays a menu, and allows the user to select an IP:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Network range to scan (adjust based on your network)
NETWORK="192.168.1.0/24"

# Scan the network for active IPs
echo "Scanning the network for active devices..."
ACTIVE_IPS=$(nmap -sn $NETWORK | grep "Nmap scan report" | awk '{print $NF}')

# Check if any IPs were found
if [ -z "$ACTIVE_IPS" ]; then
    echo "No active devices found on the network."
    exit 1
fi

# Display the list of IPs to the user
echo "Select an IP address from the following list:"
select SELECTED_IP in $ACTIVE_IPS "Quit"; do
    case $SELECTED_IP in
        "Quit")
            echo "Exiting..."
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            if [ -n "$SELECTED_IP" ]; then
                echo "You selected: $SELECTED_IP"
                break
            else
                echo "Invalid selection. Please try again."
            fi
            ;;
    esac
done

# Use the selected IP for printer setup
PRINTER_NAME="my_printer"
PRINTER_URI="ipp://$SELECTED_IP"

echo "Removing old printer configuration..."
sudo lpadmin -x $PRINTER_NAME

echo "Adding printer with selected URI..."
sudo lpadmin -p $PRINTER_NAME -E -v $PRINTER_URI -m everywhere

echo "Printer setup complete. Testing print..."
lp -d $PRINTER_NAME /path/to/testpage.pdf
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Network Scan**:
   - `nmap -sn $NETWORK`: Scans the specified network range (`192.168.1.0/24`) for active devices.
   - `grep "Nmap scan report"`: Filters the output to extract IP addresses.
   - `awk '{print $NF}'`: Extracts the last field (the IP address) from the scan results.

2. **Menu Selection**:
   - `select SELECTED_IP in $ACTIVE_IPS "Quit"; do`: Displays a menu of active IPs and an option to quit.
   - `case $SELECTED_IP in`: Handles the user's selection.

3. **Printer Setup**:
   - Uses the selected IP to configure the printer URI (`ipp://$SELECTED_IP`).
   - Removes any existing printer configuration with `sudo lpadmin -x $PRINTER_NAME`.
   - Adds the printer with the selected URI and tests a print job.

---

### Prerequisites

1. **Install `nmap` or `arp-scan`**:
   - On Debian/Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nmap
     ```
   - On CentOS/RHEL:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install nmap
     ```

2. **Adjust the Network Range**:
   - Modify the `NETWORK` variable to match your local network range (e.g., `192.168.0.0/24` or `10.0.0.0/24`).

---

### Example Output

```
Scanning the network for active devices...
Select an IP address from the following list:
1) 192.168.1.1
2) 192.168.1.100
3) 192.168.1.101
4) Quit
#? 2
You selected: 192.168.1.100
Removing old printer configuration...
Adding printer with selected URI...
Printer setup complete. Testing print...
```

---

### Notes

1. **Security**:
   - Be cautious when scanning networks, especially in enterprise environments. Ensure you have permission to scan the network.

2. **Dynamic IPs**:
   - If the printer's IP changes frequently, consider using DNS or a static lease in your DHCP server.

3. **Alternative Tools**:
   - If `nmap` is not available, you can use `arp-scan` for a simpler scan:
     ```bash
     arp-scan --localnet | grep -Eo '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
     ```

This script provides a user-friendly way to select a printer IP dynamically, making it easier to manage printers in environments with changing IP addresses.
